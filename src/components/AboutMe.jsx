            <p>Hello, my name is Xavier Mendoza. I am a passionate and dedicated full-stack web developer with a rich background in software development. My journey in coding began years ago, and over time, I have gained proficiency in seven different programming languages, including C++, C#, C, Free-Basic, JavaScript, Python, and HTML. This diverse skill set allows me to approach problems with a versatile perspective and create innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>As a full-stack developer, I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications using modern technologies. My expertise includes working with front-end frameworks like React and Bootstrap, as well as back-end tools such as MongoDB for database management and Postman for API testing. I am also skilled in using Tailwind CSS to create sleek, responsive designs.</p>
            <p>I thrive in environments that challenge me to continuously learn and grow, and I am always eager to take on new projects that push the boundaries of what can be achieved with technology. Whether it's collaborating with a team or working independently, my goal is to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that meet the needs of both users and businesses.</p>
